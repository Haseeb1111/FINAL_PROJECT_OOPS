The design patterns I implemented was simple except strategy design pattern. I spent 3 hours thinking what should I include in facilites because some of them are same and some of them are different so I could not put all of them in same strategy code. So, I narrowed down facilites to only food facilites that students in hostel can select which time of food they want to add in their food facilities.
